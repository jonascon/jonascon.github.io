Hi! I am a fourth-year PhD student in theoretical computer science at Lund University. My advisor is <a href="https://www.ctr.maths.lu.se/matstat/staff/tatyana/">Tatyana Turova</a>. My research concerns computational complexity theory and proof complexity in particular. I am especially interested in understanding the complexity of (random) constraint satisfaction problems. 

# Education
- M.Sc. in Mathematics, joint degree between <a href="https://www.su.se/english/">Stockholm University</a> and <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>, Stockholm, Sweden.
- B.Sc. in Engineering Physics, <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>, Stockholm, Sweden.
