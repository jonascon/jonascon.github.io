Hi! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/miao-group/">MIAO Group</a> headed by <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/">Jakob Nordstr√∂m</a>, active at Lund University and the University of Copenhagen. I received my M.Sc in Mathematics and B.Sc. in Engineering Physics from <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in Stockholm, Sweden. My research concerns computational complexity theory and proof complexity in particular, especially with an algebraic flavour. I am interested both in concrete lower bounds and in interconnections between proof complexity and circuit, query, and communication complexity. 

You can find my CV <a href="https://github.com/jonascon/jonascon.github.io/CV-jonas-conneryd.pdf">here</a>.
