Hi! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/miao-group/">MIAO Group</a> headed by <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/">Jakob Nordstr√∂m</a>, active at Lund University and the University of Copenhagen. My research concerns computational complexity theory and proof complexity in particular. I am interested both in lower bounds and in interconnections between proof complexity and circuit, query and communication complexity.
