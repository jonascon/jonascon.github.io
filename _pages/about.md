## About me
Hi! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/miao-group/">MIAO Group</a> <br/> headed by <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/">Jakob Nordstr√∂m</a> <br/>, active at Lund University and the University of Copenhagen. My research concerns computational complexity theory and proof complexity in particular. I am interested both in lower bounds and in interconnections between proof complexity and circuit, query and communication complexity. 

## Education
- M.Sc. in Mathematics; joint degree between <a href="https://www.su.se/english/">Stockholm University</a> <br/> and <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> <br/>, Stockholm, Sweden.
- B.Sc. in Engineering Physics; <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> <br/>, Stockholm, Sweden.
