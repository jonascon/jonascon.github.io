Hi! I am a PhD student in theoretical computer science at Lund University, supervised by href="https://derezende.github.io/">Susanna de Rezende</a>. My research concerns computational complexity theory and proof complexity in particular. I am interested both in lower bounds and in interconnections between proof complexity and circuit, query and communication complexity.
